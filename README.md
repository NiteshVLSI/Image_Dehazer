# Image_Dehazer

This Project is based on the implementation of adaptive Haze Removal Method for hazy images.The objective of this project is to obtain a Haze Free image at the output when the given input image is a foggy image.The block diagram of the architecture for this defogging algorithm is seen below. The schematics and simulations were verifed in Xilinx Vivado.
